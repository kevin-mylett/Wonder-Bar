<h1>Wonder-Bar</h1>

This is the repository for the Wonder-Bar website. The live website can be found here -> <a href="https://www.wonder-bar.co.uk/">https://www.wonder-bar.co.uk</a>.

The site uses Wordpress as a CMS. 

The Wonder-Bar child theme was solely developed by myself (Kevin Mylett).

The .gitignore file removes all other files (Worpdress Core, plugins etc..)
